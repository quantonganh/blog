Hello. I'm Quan.
I started my career as a .NET developer. Then my passionate on Linux and open source led me to a different direction, a system administrator.
With a strong background in Linux system administration, I was gradually moving to backend. I'm currently working as a software engineer. In spare time, I teach my wife to program to [automate her office tasks](../../../2021/06/10/automate-office-tasks).

I enjoy working in the fields that can make a different in people's lives or allow me to help others.

I've been trying to have a good work-life balance. Leaving work on time, picking up my child from school, then we can talk about our day on the way back home. We love to travel together to have stories to tell (and collect passport stamps).

My favourite sports are: table tennis and badminton. I'm scared to speak in front of a crowd but sometime [I can sing](https://www.nhaccuatui.com/bai-hat/dem-thay-ta-la-thac-do-tui-hat.mIZebDHzdj.html). I'm a lover of nature, street photography.
